**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
It is important to test code to make sure that it is both functional and secure. This can be done in multiple different ways whether it is JUnit testing, code review, or some other form of testing, every little bit helps the system function properly. Testing can also identify potential issues in code security that can be fixed to make the code more secure.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Interpreting user needs and making sure that everything that they asked for is included in the development of systems. By having meetings and discussing with the client, we can get the information about the requirements, but we still need to put those requirements into code. By using JUnit tests, we can make sure that the requirements are met and the system that we are developing will be best for the client.

**How do I approach designing software?**
It is important to design software with the client in mind and know that it will have to be reviewed or tested in some way. Additionally, it is important to make sure that as many aspects of the code are tested as possible and any issues that are found are fixed as soon as possible.
